# WeatherApp

weather app for android (java)

## Getting Started

(api keys were deleted from app)

Open project in Android Studio and wait, until build is over
Then just run the app by the clicking Shift+F10 or click at green triangle at top right of IDE

You will screen with 2 button and fragment(Google autocomplete)
Tap at the fragment, enter city(English letters only), then just tup the refresh buton
For forecast you need firstly choose city, than tap refresh button, than tap weather button
After that ypu will be able to see forecast for 5 days divided by 3 hour

not every city was added to openweathermap, so sometimes, when you click on city,
that you never heard of, app will probably crash (trying to fix nov)
